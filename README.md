## Prerequisites

- [JDK 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use the `parallelRun` gradle task.

```bash
./gradlew parallelRun
```

The API and client will run on ports `8080` and `3000` respectively. In addition,
a proxy is configured so requests from the client can be made to the API without
worrying about CORS.

## REST API

The REST API is secured using JWT. A token can be generated by sending a `POST`
request to `/api/login`.

The following resources have been implemented:

| Method   | Path                              | Description |
|----------|-----------------------------------|--------------
| `POST`   | `/api/login`                      | Generates a JWT token
| `GET`    | `/api/products`                   | Returns a list of products, grouped by category
| `GET`    | `/api/products?category=:name`    | Filters the product list by the given category
| `GET`    | `/api/products/:id`               | Returns a single product
| `POST`   | `/api/register`                   | Registers a new customer account
| `GET`    | `/api/users`                      | Returns a list of all users
| `GET`    | `/api/users/:user`                | Returns a single user
| `GET`    | `/api/users/:user/cart`           | Returns the items in the user's cart
| `POST`   | `/api/users/:user/cart`           | Puts an item into the user's cart
| `DELETE` | `/api/users/:user/cart`           | Deletes all items from the user's cart
| `DELETE` | `/api/users/:user/cart/:item`     | Deletes a single item from the user's cart
